# Portfolio

Howdy! My name is Muhammad Oshean Lehrmann, and I have recently graduated from UC Berkeley. This website showcases both the biology and the computer science projects I have worked on during my education, and will be updated with any personal projects I start moving forward. Some projects cannot be shown in some capacity in order to hide potential solutions for future classes.
