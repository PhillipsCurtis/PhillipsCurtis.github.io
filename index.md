# Portfolio

Howdy! My name is Muhammad Oshean Lehrmann, and I have recently graduated from UC Berkeley. This website showcases both the biology and the computer science projects I have worked on during my education, and will be updated with any personal projects I start moving forward. Some projects cannot be shown in some capacity in order to hide potential solutions for future classes.

## Work Experience

### Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium

Student Pathways Intern – Mathematics and Statistics
Aberdeen Testing Center
Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD
40 hrs/week, May 2019 – May 2021
- Modified a tank animation program in MATLAB to include approximations of angular velocity of the
hydraulic bridge launcher system on a JAB tank. This program used test data to produce an animation
of the deployment of a bridge from the tank.
- Created a MATLAB application that processes automotive testing data and generates custom graphs
and excel files based on an engineer’s specifications. Included a GUI that allowed for variable SQL
scripting to download and save project data from a network drive.

- Analyzed and generated statistics on test failures for several projects, which included formal write-
ups for company reports.

- Worked extensively on a quantitative comparison between two tests for a large project. This entailed
generating google earth files in KML using MATLAB. The code written would be used to showcase
other projects test data in a new format.
- Worked as a data analyst on an autonomous convoy system. Developed a script to detect breakage in
the convoy and record failures. Graphs were produced to recreate the path of the vehicles and
highlight errors in the self-driving.
